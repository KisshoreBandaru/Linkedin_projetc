Listening to them, guiding them, and seeing even a small impact of my words made me realize: 𝐆𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐬 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭

culture,"Your people aren’t just employees.They’re your reflection.

When I look at my team, I don’t just see titles or roles.

I see:
→ The values we stand for
→ The clarity we’ve built together
→ The leadership we choose to model

Because people mirror the culture you build.

If you cut corners — they will too.

If you show up with heart and discipline — they’ll rise with you.

That’s why I don’t just train people.

I invest in culture."
culture,that culture isn't just about free snacks and bean bags. It's about creating a space where everyone can do their best work!
culture,"During interviews, candidates are often assessed for culture fit—how well they align with the existing team.

However, it's equally important to consider culture add—what new perspectives or experiences they bring.

Culture add can introduce fresh ideas, diverse thinking, and creative problem-solving. It helps break the mold and encourages innovation within teams.
 
By focusing on culture add, we open doors to growth and future-proof our organization."
culture,"If your best employees are leaving,It's not them.


It's your culture.

They don't leave companies, names or titles.
They leave toxic work environments.

culture,"Salary attracts talents, but respect and recognitions help to retain those talents. But a great work culture helps those talents to thrive."
culture,A company’s work culture is reflected in how employees feel on Sunday night about going to work on Monday.
culture,"Culture is not pizza Fridays. It is trust, safety and empathy."
culture,"It’s not the pay — it’s the place.. 

Salary is never the first reason employees leave organisations. It’s usually the last.

1. Toxic culture – It drains energy and impacts mental health. Even good pay can’t fix a bad environment.

2. Lack of appreciation – Effort without recognition feels empty. A simple “well done” goes a long way.

3. Being ignored – When ideas are dismissed and voices unheard. People stop trying where they feel invisible.

4. No growth – Repetition without 
learning leads to frustration. Everyone seeks progress, not just a paycheck.

Yes, salary matters.
But respect, culture, and growth matter more."
culture,"When a company provides a flexible workspace and freedom over working hours, it fosters a flat approach to incremental innovation, allowing employees to complete their work with passion. Work becomes enjoyable, sparking creativity without pressure. This kind of culture builds innovative ideas and reinforces a flat structure where everyone is equally important. As a result, employees are more likely to love their work."
culture,"In an industry where talent is the core asset, pushing longer work hours without revisiting compensation, flexibility, or employee experience is not only disheartening but also unsustainable.

Work culture must evolve with the times — respecting work-life balance, valuing output over hours, and aligning with market standards in both pay and people policies.

Employees deserve more than extended hours — they deserve respect, recognition, and real rewards.

To all organizations out there: Please build cultures that attract and retain talent through empathy, not exhaustion."
culture,Employees Don't Leave Companies-They Leave Managers Who Make Them Feel Worthless.
culture,"90% of an organization’s work culture depends on a manager’s behavior.
It all comes down to:

How mid-level managers deal with their teams
How they support and onboard new team members
How fairly they treat everyone
How unbiased their decisions are
How responsibly they own up to mistakes
How they give credit to the ones who truly deserve it
How they make the team feel engaged and motivated
How they build a team others would actually wish to be a part of
But here’s the harsh truth:

Only 1 in 10 managers truly strive to build such teams.
The rest are busy chasing their own promotions, recognition, and personal gains.

If organizations started taking anonymous feedback from team members about their managers, a lot of hidden issues would surface.

And maybe—just maybe—we’d start creating workplaces that people genuinely enjoy.

I’m not saying all managers are toxic. But yes, most of them need serious work.

Managers are the face of the team—and of the company.

They must be fair, transparent, and genuinely invested in their people."
culture,"Amazing colleagues, supportive leadership, and a culture that fosters growth – couldn't ask for a better workplace"
culture,"Playing football after work was almost treated like a compliance violation.

1. Why are you wasting time?
2. Games are for kids!
3. The office is for work, not for fun.

Meanwhile, at places that get it, folks show up after hours, with football kits, TT bats, yoga mats, having the time of their lives.

No judgment. Just balance.

Imagine that:-
Adults playing games, and still managing to build world-class products. Shocking.

A new column that I plan to share on what doesn’t sit neatly at the centre.
Not the loudest voices.
Not the cleanest categories.
Not the headlines, the talking points, or the five-point plans.
But the texture beneath.
The ideas in draft.
The uncomfortable thoughts. The cultural contradictions. The things we almost say but don’t.
In the Margins is where I’ll write about the edges — of culture, communication, creativity, work, influence, technology, and the performance of it all.
It’s not meant to be reactive or urgent.
 It’s meant to be attentive.

culture,"Giving salary is not a personal favor; it's a contractual obligation and payment for work performed.

Employees are entitled to their wages for the time & hard work they put in. A salary is earned compensation for hard work, competence, and knowledge, not a gift or act of kindness!

A good work culture company always promotes their employees for their hard work and contribution towards the firm"
